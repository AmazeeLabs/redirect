Readme
------

Redirect module examines incoming URLs and redirects them as configured. This module is
useful for administrators who cannot use URL rewriting (aka mod_rewrite). If
you can use mod_rewrite on Apache, you probably should not use this module, since
URL rewriting is more efficient than redirects.

Feel free to improve this module and upload your improvements to Contrib.

Requirements
------------

This module requires the Drupal 4.1

Installation
------------

1. Copy the redirect.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
automatically detect it. Activiate it in Site Configuration -> module selector

2. Add an array similar the one below to your configuration file (aka conf.php).
This array is named 'redirect_pairs' and has regular expressions keys and an URLs as values. You may
list as many array pairs as you wish. They are evaluated in the same order as listed in your
config file.

Example:

// array key is a regular expression. array value should be an absolute URL
$redirect_pairs = array (
  "node.php" => "http://www.cnn.com",
  "blog" => "http://www.drop.org"
);
